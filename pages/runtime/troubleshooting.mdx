# Troubleshooting Common Runtime Issues

This page covers common issues you may encounter when using the Wasmer runtime and how to resolve them.

## Missing Shared Libraries

When running WebAssembly applications that depend on shared libraries, you may encounter errors if the required libraries cannot be found on your system.

### Error Message

Starting with recent versions of Wasmer, you'll see detailed error messages that show exactly where Wasmer looked for the missing library:

```
error: Spawn failed
╰─▶ 1: Linker error: Failed to find shared library libexample.so: 
           /lib/libexample.so: entry not found
           /usr/lib/libexample.so: entry not found
           /usr/local/lib/libexample.so: entry not found
```

This error indicates that Wasmer searched for `libexample.so` in multiple standard library paths but couldn't find it in any of them.

### Root Cause

This issue occurs when:

1. **Missing library**: The required shared library is not installed on your system
2. **Wrong library path**: The library is installed but not in one of the standard search paths
3. **Architecture mismatch**: The library exists but is compiled for a different architecture
4. **Permission issues**: The library file exists but cannot be accessed due to file permissions

### Solutions

#### 1. Install the Missing Library

First, identify what library is missing from the error message. Then install it using your system's package manager:

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
# For development libraries, often needed for linking
sudo apt-get install lib<name>-dev

# For runtime libraries
sudo apt-get install lib<name>
```

**CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:**
```bash
# For development libraries
sudo yum install lib<name>-devel
# or on newer systems:
sudo dnf install lib<name>-devel

# For runtime libraries
sudo yum install lib<name>
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install <library-name>

# Using MacPorts
sudo port install <library-name>
```

#### 2. Add Custom Library Paths

If your library is installed in a non-standard location, you can help Wasmer find it by setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/your/libraries:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
wasmer run your-app.wasm
```

On macOS, use `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` instead:

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/your/libraries:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
wasmer run your-app.wasm
```

#### 3. Create Symbolic Links

If the library exists with a different name or version, you can create a symbolic link:

```bash
# Example: if you have libexample.so.1 but need libexample.so
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libexample.so.1 /usr/lib/libexample.so
```

#### 4. Check Library Architecture

Ensure the library matches your system architecture:

```bash
# Check the architecture of a library file
file /path/to/library.so

# Check your system architecture
uname -m
```

### Standard Library Search Paths

Wasmer searches for shared libraries in these standard locations:

- `/lib/`
- `/usr/lib/`
- `/usr/local/lib/`
- Paths specified in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (Linux) or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` (macOS)
- Paths specified in `/etc/ld.so.conf` (Linux)

<Callout type="info">
The exact search paths may vary depending on your operating system and configuration. The error message will show you exactly which paths were searched.

### Debugging Tips

1. **Use `ldd` to check dependencies**: For Linux systems, you can use `ldd` to see what libraries a binary depends on:
   ```bash
   ldd your-binary
   ```

2. **Check if the library is in the system**: Search for the library file:
   ```bash
   find /usr -name "*libname*" 2>/dev/null
   locate libname.so
   ```

3. **Verify library loading**: Use `ldconfig` to check the library cache:
   ```bash
   ldconfig -p | grep libname
   ```

4. **Run with verbose output**: Use Wasmer's logging to get more detailed information:
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=debug wasmer run your-app.wasm
   ```

## Other Common Issues

### Permission Denied Errors

If you encounter permission denied errors when running WebAssembly files:

```bash
# Make sure the .wasm file is executable
chmod +x your-app.wasm

# Or run with explicit permissions
wasmer run ./your-app.wasm
```

### Module Loading Errors

If you see errors about module format or compatibility:

1. **Check the WebAssembly file**: Ensure your `.wasm` file is valid:
   ```bash
   wasmer inspect your-app.wasm
   ```

2. **Verify the target**: Make sure the WebAssembly module was compiled for the correct target (WASI, WASIX, etc.)

3. **Update Wasmer**: Ensure you're using a recent version of Wasmer:
   ```bash
   wasmer self-update
   ```
