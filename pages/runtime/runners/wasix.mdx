# WASIX Runner

WASIX is the long term stabilization and support of the existing [WASI ABI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/application-abi.md)
plus additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing
gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical and useful applications to be compiled and used.

WASIX was created by the Wasmer team to speed up the Wasmification of codebases around the world!

You can check more about WASIX on the [website](https://wasix.org/).

## WASIX Library Features

The WASIX library supports different feature configurations to optimize for specific use cases:

### `wasi-common` Feature

The `wasi-common` feature provides a minimal WASIP1 implementation designed to reduce binary size for applications that don't need the full WASIX feature set. This is particularly useful for:

- Applications with strict size constraints
- Simple WASI programs that don't require WASIX extensions
- Embedded or resource-constrained environments

To use the `wasi-common` feature in your Rust project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml filename="Cargo.toml" copy
[dependencies]
wasix = { version = "0.12", features = ["wasi-common"] }
```

### Other Features

- **`sys`**: Full system integration with native threading and networking support
- **`js`**: JavaScript/browser compatibility for running in web environments

Note: Only one of these features (`sys`, `js`, or `wasi-common`) can be enabled at a time.

## Usage

To use the WASIX runner, you need to specify the runner for you package in your `wasmer.toml` file:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
# ...

[[command]]
name = "proxy"
module = "<your-module>"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"
```
