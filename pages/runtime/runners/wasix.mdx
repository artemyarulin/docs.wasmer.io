# WASIX Runner

WASIX is the long term stabilization and support of the existing [WASI ABI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/application-abi.md)
plus additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing
gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical and useful applications to be compiled and used.

WASIX was created by the Wasmer team to speed up the Wasmification of codebases around the world!

You can check more about WASIX on the [website](https://wasix.org/).

## Usage

To use the WASIX runner, you need to specify the runner for you package in your `wasmer.toml` file:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
# ...

[[command]]
name = "proxy"
module = "<your-module>"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"
```

## Dynamic Linking Support

WASIX now supports dynamic linking, allowing WebAssembly modules to load and link other WebAssembly libraries at runtime. This enables:

- **Modular Applications**: Split large applications into smaller, reusable modules
- **Plugin Systems**: Load functionality dynamically based on runtime conditions  
- **Shared Libraries**: Reduce binary size by sharing common code between modules
- **Threading Support**: Dynamic modules work seamlessly with WASIX threading

Dynamic linking in WASIX provides three main syscalls:
- `dlopen()` - Load a dynamic library
- `dlsym()` - Resolve symbols from loaded libraries
- `dl_invalid_handle()` - Check if a library handle is valid

For detailed information on using dynamic linking, see the [Dynamic Linking Guide](/runtime/runners/wasix/dynamic-linking).
