# WASIX Runner

WASIX is the long term stabilization and support of the existing [WASI ABI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/legacy/application-abi.md)
plus additional non-invasive syscall extensions that complete the missing
gaps sufficiently enough to enable real, practical and useful applications to be compiled and used.

WASIX was created by the Wasmer team to speed up the Wasmification of codebases around the world!

You can check more about WASIX on the [website](https://wasix.org/).

## Key Features

WASIX extends WASI with several important capabilities:

- **Networking**: TCP/UDP sockets for client and server applications
- **Threading**: Multi-threading support for parallel processing
- **Advanced file operations**: Additional filesystem capabilities
- **Dynamic linking**: Load additional WebAssembly modules at runtime (similar to shared libraries)
- **Signals**: Process signal handling
- **Advanced process management**: Fork, exec, and other process operations

For more details on dynamic linking, see the [Dynamic Linking documentation](/runtime/features/dynamic-linking).

## Usage

To use the WASIX runner, you need to specify the runner for you package in your `wasmer.toml` file:

```toml filename="wasmer.toml" copy
# ...

[[command]]
name = "proxy"
module = "<your-module>"
runner = "https://webc.org/runner/wasi"
```
